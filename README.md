This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

```



# Chatbot Application

This is a chatbot application built using **React** and **OpenAI API**. The chatbot interacts with users and generates responses based on the input prompt. The OpenAI API is used to provide dynamic and relevant responses to user queries, simulating an intelligent assistant for various tasks.

## Features

- **Real-time Chat Interface**: Allows users to chat with the chatbot.
- **OpenAI Integration**: The chatbot uses the OpenAI API to generate human-like responses based on user input.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable with new features or use cases.
- **Timer-Based Message Delivery**: The bot sends responses in intervals to simulate a conversational experience.
- **Supports Multi-Line Responses**: Handles multi-line responses from the OpenAI API.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-turbo model)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (optional based on your project setup)
- **State Management**: React `useState`, `useEffect`

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-application.git
cd chatbot-application

2. Install dependencies:
  npm install

3.  Set up OpenAI API Key:
To connect the chatbot with the OpenAI API, you'll need to set up an API key from OpenAI. Once you have your API key, replace the placeholder in the Actionprovider.js file with your key:

const openai = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: "your-api-key-here",  // Replace with your actual OpenAI API key
    baseURL: "https://api.aimlapi.com",
    dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true,
});


4. 4. Run the application:
  npm start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
